# KYC Webhook

Receives webhook callbacks from the KYC provider (Sumsub). This endpoint is called automatically when verification status changes.

<Warning>
  This endpoint is for KYC provider → Signum communication only. Do not call directly.
</Warning>

## Authentication

Webhooks are authenticated via signature verification using the KYC provider's secret key.

## Webhook Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `applicantReviewed` | Verification completed (approved or rejected) |
| `applicantPending` | Additional review required |
| `applicantOnHold` | Verification paused |
| `applicantCreated` | New applicant created |

## Processing

When a webhook is received, Signum:

1. Verifies the signature
2. Updates the user's KYC status in the database
3. Publishes `kyc.status.changed` event to Kafka
4. Triggers attestation anchoring (if approved)

## Response

Always returns 200 OK to acknowledge receipt.
