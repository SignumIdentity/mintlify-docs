# Signum Identity Platform

Signum is an enterprise-grade **Federated Identity Provider** that bridges verified identities across blockchain networks. It provides a unified authentication layer with cryptographic attestations that work seamlessly across Solana, EVM chains, and Canton Network.

## The Problem

Web3 identity is fragmented. Users maintain separate wallets, separate KYC verifications, and separate identities across every blockchain they interact with. For institutions, this means:

- **Repeated KYC** for every chain integration
- **No portable compliance** between networks  
- **Siloed identity data** that can't be verified cross-chain
- **Complex wallet management** for multi-chain operations

## The Solution

Signum provides a single identity layer that:

  <Card title="Unified Authentication" icon="fingerprint">
    OAuth2/OIDC compliant auth that works with existing enterprise systems. One login, access to all chains.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portable KYC" icon="shield-check">
    Verify once, attest everywhere. KYC attestations bridge automatically across Solana, EVM, and Canton.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deterministic Wallets" icon="wallet">
    Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) on Solana tied to your identity. No seed phrases, no key management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise Ready" icon="building">
    SOC2 compliant, institutional-grade infrastructure with rate limiting, audit logging, and revocation.

## How It Works

    User->>App: Login request
    App->>Signum: OAuth2 authorize
    Signum->>User: Hosted login
    User->>Signum: Authenticate
    Signum->>App: Authorization code
    App->>Signum: Exchange for tokens
    Signum->>App: Access + ID tokens
    
    Note over App,Signum: User is now authenticated
    
    App->>Signum: Initiate KYC
    Signum->>KYC: Create verification
    User->>KYC: Complete verification
    KYC->>Signum: Webhook callback
    
    Note over Signum,Chains: KYC approved
    
    Signum->>Chains: Create attestations
    Chains-->>Signum: Confirm anchoring
    Signum->>App: Attestation ready
```

## Supported Chains

| Chain | Features | Attestation Type |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Solana** | PDA wallets, Token 2022 transfer hooks, compliance enforcement | Anchor account + Transfer hook |
| **EVM** | Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism | ERC-3643 Identity Registry |
| **Canton** | DAML smart contracts, institutional privacy | Party ID + KYC Contract |

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Federated Identity">
    Signum acts as an OAuth2/OIDC identity provider. Your application redirects users to Signum for authentication, then receives verified identity claims in standard JWT format. Works with any OAuth2 client library.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multi-Chain Identities">
    Each user has linked identities across chains: Solana PDAs, EVM wallet addresses, and Canton party IDs. All tied to a single Signum identity with unified KYC status.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Attestations">
    Cryptographic proofs of identity verification anchored on-chain. When a user passes KYC, Signum creates attestations on all linked chains, enabling compliant DeFi, tokenized assets, and regulated transfers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)">
    On Solana, wallet addresses are derived deterministically from email hashes. No private keys to manage—the program itself controls the wallet. Users can transact without seed phrases.
  </Accordion>

## Quick Start

Get integrated in 5 minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Credentials">
    Register your application at [app.signum.id](https://app.signum.id) to receive your `client_id` and configure redirect URIs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement OAuth2 Flow">
    Use any OAuth2 library to redirect users to Signum's authorization endpoint:
    ```
    https://api.signum.id/oauth/authorize?
      client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
      redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/callback&
      response_type=code&
      scope=openid profile email chain:read
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exchange for Tokens">
    After authentication, exchange the authorization code for access and ID tokens.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Chain Identities">
    Use the access token to retrieve the user's linked wallets and attestation status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Infrastructure

Signum is built on enterprise infrastructure:

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Cache** | Dragonfly | Rate limiting, session storage, token revocation |
| **Events** | Kafka/Redpanda | Cross-chain attestation sync, KYC webhooks |
| **Database** | Supabase (Postgres) | Identity storage with RLS policies |
| **Chains** | Helius (Solana), viem (EVM), Canton Ledger API | Multi-chain operations |

See the [Architecture](/architecture) page for full infrastructure documentation.
